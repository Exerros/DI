# Ask a user for a word
# Write a program that creates a dictionary. This dictionary stores the indexes of each letter in a list.

# Make sure the letters are the keys.
# Make sure the letters are strings.
# Make sure the indexes are stored in a list and those lists are values.


# word = input("Please enter a word: ")

# result = {}
# for i, letter in enumerate(word):
#     if letter in result:
#         result[letter].append(i)
#     else:
#         result[letter] = [i]

# print(result)



# Challenge 2
# Create a program that prints a list of the items you can afford in the store with the money you have in your wallet.
# Sort the list in alphabetical order.
# Return “Nothing” if you can’t afford anything from the store.

store = {
    "apple": "$1", 
    "drone": "$699", 
    "Iron-man Helmet": "$100", 
    "ice cream": "$5", 
    "tv": "1,000"
    }

# didn't manage to do it, i coudn't find a way to remove the" $" and the "," and make it work.
